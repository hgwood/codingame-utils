# Utility functions for CodinGame

Includes helpers for:
- assertion
- parsing
- collections
- functional programming
- 2D vector manipulation

## Getting started

Start using these functions in CodinGame right now by copying the content of
https://unpkg.com/codingame-utils/dist/index.js into the CodinGame IDE! You
will then have access to the functions through the `utils` variable.

```js
utils.assert.ok(false)
utils.functions.compose(f, g)
utils.vector.between({x: 0, y: 3}, {x: 1, y: 2})
```
